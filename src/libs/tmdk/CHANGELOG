v0.0.2
- Added support for tileset exports in case of Cesium
- Fixed missing dataType in entity creation. This is the case where an entity has an internal property used as a parameter for data sources like sitewise.
- Added throttling of create entity api calls. 100ms delay. Better detection is needed.

v0.0.1

- handle scenario where scene files contain absolute s3 paths
- update README to make global installation optional
- add support for mac/linux packaging
- add error handling that workspace exists during deploy
- handle case where model references are in subdirectories in s3

known bugs:
- should update deploy to make URIs absolute path (preferred over relative to avoid confusion)
- should add error handling for when workspaces dont exist - during init
- look into a verbose mode for detecting when requests are getting throttled
- "handle" scenario where scene contains models from other accounts
- optimization: avoid unnecessary component-type calls during deploy

feature requests:
- support Grafana import/export
- tmdk nuke: handle case where IAM role for workspace deleted
- support for creating workspace via tool
- support for replacing accountIds
- support for replacing external links from one account to another (like grafana internal links)
